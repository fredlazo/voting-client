  After reading similar issues, it appears that with "webpack": "^2.2.1" and "webpack-dev-server": "^1.16.3",
the loader should read 'react-hot-loader!babel-loader' and
resolve extensions should read "['*', '.js', '.jsx']" instead of blank for the first extension.

In index.jsx...
These two were switched around and I was getting 'undefined' for socket.

const socket = io(`${location.protocol}//${location.hostname}:8090`);
socket.on('state', state =>
  store.dispatch(setState(state))
);

const createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(
  remoteActionMiddleware(socket)
)(createStore);
const store = createStoreWithMiddleware(reducer);
